# HOWTO Forum, work in progress

My imageboard-like forum on Flask.

0. pipenv install<br>
1. pipenv shell<br>
2. FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run

The goal is to learn the Flask + Apache-server + SQL deployment.

## A sort of journal

#### update one

I ran into trouble with deployment of Flask on Apache. I decided that it isn't worth it to waste time solving them and drop the Apache. Still, I managed to learn basics of Apache and deploy two static sites via virtual hosts.<br>
I also ran into Pipenv and find it very good.<br>
Basics chassi for the forum is ready, now going to learn SQL.

#### update two

I took a basic SQL course. It turned out that the main difference with SQLite is the way of deploymend and access a db through the web interface.<br>
I think that this is sufficient knowledge for my level. Switching to SQLite, simply for ease of distribution.<br>
I learned and clarified the things I wanted to. Now I'll just write a working forum.

#### update three

There's so much depth in sites development, even the simplest thing can be a rabbit hole to endless variants of implementation and new fields of knowledge.<br>
Need in multiple forms lead me to WTForms package, that I going to learn now.

#### update four

I wish that 22/02/24 is newer happened...<br>
My country invaded another free country â€” country of my friends, country where have I been before in my childhood, from which my father's mother from, where I wanted to go when I become a programmer and earn some money. Thousends of innosent people dying along with their cyties, millions run. This is just some endless nightmare. And there is almost nothing I can do.<br>
I just hope that if I keep working hard, one day I will have enough resources to help other people.

#### finale

I think I'm done with this project. There is much more that I want to do: in design and usability. But there is nothing that I can not do, so I don't learn something new from it. The site is fully working and I could expand and refactor it just eternally. So I think it's good time to stop and learn something new.<br>
It turns out that I really need to learn and practice OOP. Because I often feel that I can make things much better by implementing them in from of objects. Like, the posts and threads in this case.
